`Android` folder is related to android app code
`IOS` folder is related to ios app code
Everything else is related to `web`

`Android` and `IOS` has `node_modules` as dependency, so the app will not work or build without `node_modules` folder. So always include them. 

If you get any errors, delete `node_modules` folder and install nodejs and run command `npm install`
